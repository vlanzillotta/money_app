Real money is a finance management app designed to let you know exactly how much money you have free at the moment. By creating future transactions the moment you know about them, Real Money removes the stress of remembering to keep that money aside so you don't spend it.

Real money also offers a set of tools and reports to help you know exactly how well you are managing your available funds. You can see very basic information like your main balance, or get into very detailed levels like seeing how much extra cash you earn per day and if you spent more or less than your daily income.

Real money also helps you plan for future expenses. If you want to have $1000 for a black Friday sale, Real Money will tell you exactly how much you need to put away out of every paycheck between now and black Friday. Why worry about scratching the money together at the last day, week or even month? Start putting the most painless amount away now and your goal will be set when you get there!
