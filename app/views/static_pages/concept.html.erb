The RealMoney Concept
=================================

The three main columns
------------------------------

_Recent Transactions_

These act as a record of where your money has gone. While not necessary for the organization of the concept, having to mark down expenses help to avoid a situation where you are missing $20 and have no memory of where it went.

If you are not intrested in tracking expenses like this, you can simple have one entry in the table called "balance". This would be your account balance at that moment and would be adjusted anytime a purchase/credit has occured.

_future transactions_

This may be renamed to "scheduled transactions". This is  place for expenses/credits that will happn on a specific day. Payroll, gym bills, monthly subscriptions.

While most examples will repeat tht fncionaly is not yet implemented.

_putaway transactions_

Similar to future transactions, these are expenses that you expct to happen in the futre but with no specific date It is used as a way to set aside money so that your day-to-day expenses are not burdened with having to remember upcoming expenses.

Some use cases could be: Saving for a car, insurance claims in the mail, Christmas shopping funds.
